								<h2>A little bit about me...</h2></br></br>
								<p>I work in the Michigan State University Department of Physics </br> and Astronomy, where I've been on the faculty since 2009.</br><br>
								  My research is in the field of high energy physics, which is the study </br> of
								  the most basic building blocks of the universe and the fundamental</br>
								  forces through 
								  which they interact. This field is also commonly known </br>
								  as elementary particle physics. 
								  Scientists working in this field explore </br>the most  fundamental questions about the nature of our universe. </br></br>
								  
								  I perform my research at the highest energy particle accelerator in </br>
								  the world along with colleagues from both MSU and around the world. </br>
								  In particular, my work focuses on understanding the physical </br>
								  mechanisms that explain why matter has mass. While mass and its </br>
								  interaction with gravity is the most clear indication that forces exist, </br>
								  the mystery of why particles have mass at all and why observed particle </br>
								  masses span such a great range remains a major focus in high energy 
								  physics. </br></br>
								  I also have interests in extentions to our current theoretical models that </br>
								  predict new, heavy gauge bosons (eg, W-/Z-prime models).  These models can provide </br>
								  an explanation for why we observe puzzling results in our relatively low-energy </br>
								  universe, by providing a very high-energy new physics mechanism.</p>

								<h2>The ATLAS Experiment</h2>
								<p>The ATLAS experiment collects data from proton collisions inside the Large Hadron Collider, which is located at the CERN research facility just outside Geneva, Switzerland.  This is where my research team and MSU colleagues work.  We collaborate with physicists from universities and laboratories around the world.</p>

								<h2>Big Data for Big Questions</h2>
								<p>The data we collect allow us to test whether our predictions for how particles interact are accurate, or if there is something else happening when we collide protons together.  The collisions produce a dense spray of particles, which we detect with the ATLAS experimental apparatus (this is all illustrated on the right).  The proton collisions occur every 25 nanoseconds, so our data sample is truly BIG and grows every day.</p>

								<h2>About my research</h2>
								<p>My professional interests cover a wide range of activities.  Here are a few highlights.</p>
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-paper-plane-o">
									<h3>Searches for Exotic Matter</h3>
									<p>My research group has been focusing lately on searches for exotic heavy resonances, which have never been seen before. You can find links to our research here.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-laptop">
									<h3>Teaching</h3>
									<p>I am priveledged to be able to teach physics to both undergraduate and graduate students at MSU. You can find links to the courses that I teach here.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3>Statistics in HEP</h3>
									<p>Most HEP results culminate in a statistical analysis of the data. Improving our methods and solving common problems is a fundamental need in our field.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-headphones">
									<h3>LHC Upgrades</h3>
									<p>We periodically upgrade the ATLAS detector to adapt to increased energy and/or collision intensity regimes.  You can find links to the MSU contributions to ATLAS upgrades here.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-heart-o">
									<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
									<p>ATLAS data is both BIG (lots of it!) and feature rich.  This is a magnet for machine learning enthusiasts.  Have a look here at what's happening at ATLAS in ML.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag-o">
									<h3>Physics Outreach</h3>
									<p>Communication to non-scientists about particle physics is an important part in the future success of our field. You can find links to HEP outreach here.</p>
